# epidemicSimulator
### Simulate what an epidemic may look like with custom inputs (infection radius, infection length, number of people, etc)


### Overview
This project was inspired by the SIR's Model: 
S:Susceptible,
I:Infectious,
R:Recovered.

Susceptible - People are vulnerable to the virus.
Infectious - People who are currently carriers.
Recovered - People who have recovered from the virus.(In this simulation to keep it simple people who are recovered are immune from the virus)



Feel free to change it up !




### Social Distancing Simulation

>Be able to see how much of a difference social distancing can make in your epidemic. 


### Random Walk Simulation

>Notice the difference when you see your people going about their normal day not taking any safety precautions.


I want to see how this project can grow! I hope you all have fun messing around and make your own version by adding your own features.

### Notes:
> Requires the "turtle" module inorder to run the GUI
